# Rainmeter-addons
⚠ This repo does not contain any skins that work by themselves, but rather addons to already existing skins like [CakeOS](https://www.deviantart.com/eldog-02/art/CakeOS-Suite-761617503) and [Polybar](https://github.com/khanhas/Polybar)

## Examples

## Dependencies (and issues)
The Polybar theme needs a custom version on the Iosevka font, which makes use of [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Make sure you have downloaded and installed the Iosevka Nerd Font.
Because of this, font options are quite limited.
This will be adressed in the future...
